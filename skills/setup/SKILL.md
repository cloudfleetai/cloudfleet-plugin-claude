# Cloudfleet Setup

Guide users through installing and configuring the Cloudfleet CLI.

## Execution Steps

### 1. Check current state

```bash
which cloudfleet && cloudfleet --version || echo "NOT_INSTALLED"
```

### 2. Install if needed

If not installed, guide the user based on their platform:

**macOS (Homebrew):**

```bash
brew install cloudfleetai/tap/cloudfleet-cli
```

**Linux (Debian/Ubuntu):**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://downloads.cloudfleet.ai/apt/pubkey.gpg | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/cloudfleet-archive-keyring.gpg >/dev/null
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/cloudfleet-archive-keyring.gpg] https://downloads.cloudfleet.ai/apt stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/cloudfleet.list
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install cloudfleet
```

**Linux (Red Hat-based):** Cloudfleet CLI is available at Cloudfleet's YUM repository for x64 and ARM architectures:

```bash
sudo tee /etc/yum.repos.d/cloudfleet.repo << 'EOF'
[cloudfleet]
name=Cloudfleet
baseurl=https://downloads.cloudfleet.ai/yum
enabled=1
gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=https://downloads.cloudfleet.ai/yum/pubkey.gpg
EOF
sudo dnf install cloudfleet
```

**Windows (winget):**

```
winget install Cloudfleet.CLI
```

### 3. Add a profile

The user needs their Organization ID (found in Console under Billing → Payment):

```bash
cloudfleet auth add-profile user default <ORGANIZATION_ID>
```

This only registers the profile. Authentication happens automatically when the user first runs a command that requires it (e.g., listing clusters), which will open a browser for login.

### 4. Verify

Check that a profile exists:

```bash
cloudfleet auth list-profiles
```

Then verify the credentials work:

```bash
cloudfleet organization describe
```

This returns info about the user's Cloudfleet organization, confirming authentication is working.

### 5. Configure kubectl (optional)

If the user wants to use kubectl with a cluster:

```bash
cloudfleet clusters kubeconfig <CLUSTER_ID>
```

This writes a kubeconfig that can be used with `kubectl cluster-info` and `kubectl get nodes`.

### 6. MCP server

Let the user know that the Cloudfleet MCP server is already configured via this plugin. They can verify it's working by asking about their clusters.

**Note**: The MCP server currently uses the `default` CLI profile only. If the user has a non-default profile, they should either configure a `default` profile pointing to the same organization, or use kubectl with `--profile` for CLI commands instead.

### 7. Feedback

Let the user know: if they have any feedback about Cloudfleet or this Claude Code plugin, we'd love to hear it — they can open a support ticket at https://console.cloudfleet.ai/support.
