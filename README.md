# Cloudfleet Plugin for Claude Code

[Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) plugin by [Cloudfleet](https://cloudfleet.ai) — operate Cloudfleet Kubernetes Engine (CFKE) and Cloudfleet Container Registry (CFCR) with guided workflows, debugging aids, and preconfigured MCP access.

## Features

- **Preconfigured MCP server** — query clusters, list resources, and get cluster info without local setup
- **kubectl guardrail** — a PreToolUse hook resolves the server each kubectl command would reach and blocks it if that server is not a CFKE cluster, plus isolated kubeconfig management. A backstop, not a security boundary: aliases and wrapper scripts bypass it.
- **Background knowledge** — CFKE architecture, CFCR usage, best practices (resource requests, load balancers, node placement) auto-triggered when relevant
- **Guided workflows** — cluster setup, fleet configuration, self-managed nodes, debugging

## Configuration

| Option | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `enable_kubectl` | boolean | Enable kubectl for direct cluster access. When disabled, read-only MCP access is used. |

## Installation

### From GitHub

```
/plugin marketplace add cloudfleetai/cloudfleet-plugin-claude
/plugin install cloudfleet@cloudfleet
/reload-plugins
```

### Local development

```bash
claude --plugin-dir /path/to/cloudfleet-plugin-claude
```

Use `/reload-plugins` to pick up changes without restarting.

Validate and lint before submitting changes:

```bash
claude plugin validate .
npx markdownlint-cli 'skills/**/*.md' 'agents/**/*.md' --config .markdownlint.json
```

## Getting Started

Once installed, try these prompts:

- `I'm getting started with Cloudfleet` — walks you through CLI setup and authentication
- `What clusters do I have?` — lists your clusters with status and details
- `Create a new cluster on Hetzner` — guided cluster and fleet setup
- `Check if my cluster follows best practices` — audits deployments for resource requests, LB policy, node placement
- `Debug my cluster, pods are stuck in Pending` — systematic debugging workflow
- `Push my app image to CFCR` — container registry guidance
- `Add a self-managed node to my cluster` — join any Linux server

## Requirements

- [Cloudfleet CLI](https://cloudfleet.ai/docs/introduction/getting-started/) v1.2+ (write commands changed their input model in 1.0)
- A Cloudfleet account with at least one configured authentication profile
- (Optional) `kubectl` for full cluster access
- `jq`, required by the kubectl guardrail hook. Without it the hook allows every command rather than blocking the session.
